# Defect Manager v1.0

An android app designed for the foundry industry that registers and organizes production defects on parts.

- References (products) are created and given a small amount of information (version and number of parts - different parts of the same product). 

- Production Dates are associated with each Reference in the format X123 (Letter representing the year and numeric value of the day).

- Reference and Production Date management is possible with Edit and Delete functions.

- Each Production Date can be associated with a Table of Defects. This table allows the register of productions defects detected on each part 
and exports the results to an Excel file, stored locally on the device. Like the Reference and Production Date activities, management is possible
with Edit, Save and Delete functions. An Export option is also available, creating an email with the attached Excel File.
